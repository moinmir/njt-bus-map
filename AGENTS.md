# Project Agent Rules

- Treat the current data schema as authoritative; do not add backward compatibility code paths or fallback behavior unless explicitly requested.
- Keep files and components small and modular. If you're editing a file and it's getting too big, think about how to refactor it and keep it small and have proper separation of concerns. Think about reducing duplication and keeping changes simple.
